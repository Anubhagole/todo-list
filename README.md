# 📝 Todo List App (React + Vite)

A simple and efficient **Todo List** application built using **React** and **Vite**. This app allows users to add, update, delete todos, and view completed tasks. It also includes routing with an About page and persistent storage using `localStorage`.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Add new todos
- ✏️ Update existing todos
- ❌ Delete todos
- ✅ View completed todos
- 🔄 Routing with **react-router-dom**:
  - `/` → Todo List
  - `/about` → About the App
- 💾 Persistent todos using **localStorage**

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- React
- Vite
- **react-router-dom** ([docs](https://reactrouter.com/6.30.1/routers/create-browser-router))  
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS3

---

---

## 🌐 Routing

- `/` → Main Todo List page where you can add, update, delete todos
- `/about` → Static page with information about the app

Routing is handled using **react-router-dom** for smooth navigation between pages.

---

## 💾 LocalStorage

- Todos are saved in the browser’s **localStorage** to persist between sessions.
- This means your tasks remain even after refreshing or closing the browser.

---

## 🧠 Learnings

Building this app helped me:

- Work with **React hooks** like `useState` and `useEffect`
- Implement routing with **react-router-dom**
- Manage persistent state with `localStorage`
- Handle CRUD operations in React components
- Use **Vite** as a fast build tool for React
